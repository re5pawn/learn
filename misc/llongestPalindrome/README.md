## Longest Palindrome

Find the length of the longest substring in the given string `s` that is the same in reverse.
As an example, if the input was "I like racecars that go fast", the substring (`racecar`) length would be `7`.
If the length of the input string is 0, return value must be `0`.

Example:
```js
"a" -> 1 
"aab" -> 2  
"abcde" -> 1
"zzbaabcd" -> 4
"I like racecars that go fast" -> 7
"" -> 0
```
